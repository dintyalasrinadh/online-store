## This Project covers fundamentals of Angular

- Multiple Modules

## Running the Application

You will need to clone the source code of online-store GitHub repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/tshaheer/online-store.git
```

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): We use Node to run a development web server and build the project. Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After the repository is cloned, go inside of the repository directory and install dependencies:

```
cd online-store
npm install
```

Run `ng serve` for a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
